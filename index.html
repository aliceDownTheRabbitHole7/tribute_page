        After the war subsided, so did the popularity of comic book superheroes. DC comics had revitalized the genre again by creating the new superhero The Flash. In order to compete in the again rising popularity, Stan Lee had helped to create The Fantastic Four with Jack Kirby in 1961. The upsurge in popularity caused the creation of many popular heroes today, including Spider-man.
